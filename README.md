#JavaScript templating

Remake of Joe Marini's JavaScript Templating course on lynda.com (JavaScript templating with Mustache, jQuery Template, Handlebars and Dust). With the exclusive use og Gulp and Browserify.

##Note:

Code has been detailed and specific pages have been created to insure a better understanding of possibilities offered by the four templating engines.
