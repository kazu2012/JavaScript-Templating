#JavaScript templating

Excellent case studies of the best use cases of four major templating engine in the industry: "jQuery Template", "Mustache", "Handlebars" and "Dust".  
This is inspired from Joe Marini's JavaScript Templating course on lynda.com. 
This remake has been done with Gulp task runner and Browserify.
